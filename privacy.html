      At Gbero, we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal
      data. This policy explains how we collect, use, store and protect your

      rights under the Nigeria Data Protection Act (NDPA) 2023. By accessing or
      using Gbero, you consent to the practices described here.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Providing our services</strong>: to register you as a user, verify your identity, schedule and manage rides, process payments and facilitate real‑time chat between passengers and drivers.</li>
      <li><strong>Compliance and safety</strong>: to verify drivers’ credentials (licence and NIN) and ensure rides are safe and lawful.</li>

      <li><strong>Legal obligations</strong>: to comply with applicable laws, regulations and NDPA requirements.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>3. Legal basis for processing</h3>
    <p>We rely on several lawful bases as defined in the NDPA to process your data:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Consent</strong>: by registering and providing your details, you consent to us processing your personal data for the purposes described. You may withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
